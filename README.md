2. Get Persona 5 Royal, Reloaded II, and .NET alongside it
3. Make a "Mods" folder in the root folder of Reloaded II
4. Import the files in the release section of this repository into that mods folder

6. Get the zip folder that has "P5R_MP_SERVER.exe" in it
7. run that executable (whoever is hosting the other person will connect to their Hamachi/Radmin IP)
8. Now everyone that wants to play Persona 5 Royal will input your Hamachi/Radmin Ip address into their Reloaded II configuration menu (Click Configure Mod when selecting Persona 5 Royal Multiplayer)
